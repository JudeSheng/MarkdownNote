### HumanLibrary / Specific Signory HL / Intersting / LiveSkills 
> Because it is so big project, so the HumanLibrary can just play as an classify and linker system  
> And also the SSHL project is also the classify and linker system which should be create by other team  
> So the SSHL should be just the summarize and branchs designer and the extensive/multi-faceted linker, that is what the team/one guy can do  
> The knowledge of the SSHL could apply for branch and linker, that is what the team/master can do, so it is 3 level system : HL,SSHL,Branch, I'd like to do the 1st and 2nd level, also the 3ed maybe, but I can only do the 2nd for now
